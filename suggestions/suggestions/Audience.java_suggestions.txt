1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the `Audience` annotation and its `Type` enum to provide clarity on their intended use and purpose.
2. If the `Type` enum is expected to grow in the future, consider using a more descriptive name for the enum, such as `AudienceType`, to improve readability and maintainability.
3. If the `value` attribute is expected to be used frequently, consider providing a default value or a more descriptive name for the attribute to clarify its purpose.
4. Consider adding validation logic to ensure that the `value` attribute contains valid `Type` entries, if applicable, to prevent misuse of the annotation.
5. If the annotation is used in multiple places, consider creating a utility class or method to handle common operations related to the `Audience` annotation, improving code reuse.
