1. Consider making the `source` field final to ensure it is immutable after construction.
2. Add input validation in the constructor to check if the `transform` parameter is null before accessing it.
3. Use a more descriptive name for the `input` parameter in the `expand` method to clarify its purpose.
4. Consider adding JavaDoc comments for the class and its methods to improve code documentation and understanding.
5. Extract the `Pipeline.applyTransform` call into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Handle potential exceptions that may arise from `source.validate()` to ensure robustness.
7. Consider using a logging framework to log the validation process or any potential issues during the execution.
