1. Extract the common logic for adding a step context into a separate method to reduce code duplication.
2. Create a constant for the string "ParallelRead" to avoid hardcoding it multiple times.
3. Move the logic for encoding the impulse element into a separate method to improve readability and separation of concerns.
4. Handle the exception in a more specific way rather than wrapping it in a generic RuntimeException.
5. Use a more descriptive variable name for `encodedImpulse` to clarify its purpose.
6. Consider using a logging framework to log the exception instead of throwing a runtime exception directly.
