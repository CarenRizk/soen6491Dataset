1. Extract the logic for determining `numShards` into a separate private method to improve readability and reduce complexity in the `getReplacementTransform` method.
2. Replace the `try-catch` block with a more specific exception handling mechanism, if possible, to avoid catching generic `Exception` and to provide more context in case of failure.
3. Consider using `Optional` for the `numShards` calculation to handle the cases where the options might not be set, which can make the code cleaner.
4. Use constants or enums for the multiplier used in `numShards` calculation (currently hardcoded as `2`) to improve maintainability and clarity.
5. Add comments to explain the purpose of key sections of the code, especially around the logic for `numShards` and the conditions for windowed and auto-sharded writes.
6. Consider logging the exception in the catch block before throwing a new `RuntimeException` to provide better debugging information.
7. Validate the `options` parameter in the constructor to ensure it is not null, which can prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions` later in the code.
