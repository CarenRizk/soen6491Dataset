1. Consolidate the repeated code in the `asPath`, `asV1Beta1Path`, and `asV1Beta2Path` methods in both `PubsubSubscription` and `PubsubTopic` classes into a single method that takes a format type as a parameter to reduce redundancy.
2. Extract the common validation logic in `validateProjectName` and `validatePubsubName` into a utility class or method to promote code reuse and reduce duplication.
3. Consider using a single regex pattern for both subscription and topic validation to simplify the code and improve maintainability.
4. Replace the `if-else` structure in the `fromPath` methods of `PubsubSubscription` and `PubsubTopic` with a strategy pattern or a factory method to improve readability and separation of concerns.
5. Use constants for the error messages in `validateProjectName` and `validatePubsubName` to avoid hardcoding strings multiple times and to facilitate easier localization if needed.
6. Refactor the `expandReadContinued` method to separate concerns by extracting the logic for handling bad records into its own method to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Consider using a builder pattern for the `PubsubSubscription` and `PubsubTopic` classes to simplify object creation and improve readability.
8. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotations from the `asV1Beta1Path` and `asV1Beta2Path` methods if they are not being used anywhere in the codebase to avoid confusion.
9. Use Java's `Optional` for nullable fields in the `Read` and `Write` classes to improve null safety and readability.
10. Consider adding Javadoc comments to public methods and classes to improve code documentation and understanding for future developers.
