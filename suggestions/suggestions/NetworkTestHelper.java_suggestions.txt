1. Remove the `synchronized` keyword from the `getAvailableLocalPort` method, as it is not necessary for thread safety when creating a new `ServerSocket` instance each time.
2. Consider adding a comment to explain the purpose of the method and how it works for better code readability.
3. Handle the case where the `ServerSocket` might fail to bind to a port by catching and logging the exception, or by providing a fallback mechanism.
4. Consider using a more descriptive exception type or custom exception to provide clearer context in case of an error.
5. If this method is part of a larger utility class, consider adding a private constructor to prevent instantiation of the `NetworkTestHelper` class.
