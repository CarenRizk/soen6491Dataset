1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose and usage.
2. Use a more descriptive type parameter name instead of `T` to enhance readability, such as `ElementType`.
3. Check if the `StreamingUnboundedRead` class can be imported statically to reduce verbosity in the `getReplacementTransform` method.
4. If applicable, consider implementing the `Serializable` interface for the class to ensure it can be serialized if needed in distributed environments.
5. Evaluate whether the `mapOutputs` method could benefit from additional validation or error handling for the inputs.
6. Consider using a more specific type for the `outputs` parameter in the `mapOutputs` method if possible, to enhance type safety.
7. Review the use of generics to ensure they are used consistently and appropriately throughout the class.
