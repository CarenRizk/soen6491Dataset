1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose and usage.
2. Use type parameters in the class declaration to specify bounds (if applicable) for better type safety and clarity.
3. Extract the creation of the `CombineGroupedValues` instance into a separate private method to improve readability and reduce complexity in the `getReplacementTransform` method.
4. Rename the method `mapOutputs` to `mapOutputs` to follow a consistent naming convention, as it currently does not follow the Java naming conventions for methods.
5. Consider adding validation for the input parameters in the `getReplacementTransform` and `mapOutputs` methods to ensure they are not null and meet expected conditions.
6. Use `@Override` annotation for the `mapOutputs` method to make it clear that it is overriding a method from the interface.
7. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `newOutput` parameter in the `mapOutputs` method to clarify its purpose.
