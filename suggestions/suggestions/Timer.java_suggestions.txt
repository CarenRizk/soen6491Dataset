1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and relevant, or provide a clear alternative if it is deprecated.
2. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods to improve documentation and clarify usage.
3. Evaluate whether the `add(long duration, TimeUnit unit)` method is necessary if the `add(Duration duration)` method is already provided; consider removing it if it adds little value.
4. If the `add(Duration duration)` method is the primary method, consider making it the only method and removing the overloaded version to simplify the interface.
5. Ensure that the `Accumulator` interface is well-defined and does not contain any deprecated methods that could affect the usability of the `Timer` interface.
