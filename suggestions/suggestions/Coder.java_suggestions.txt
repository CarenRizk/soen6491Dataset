1. Remove the deprecated `encode` and `decode` methods that accept a `Context` parameter, as they simply call the non-deprecated versions without using the context.
2. Consider using `java.util.Objects` instead of `org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v32_1_2_jre.com.google.common.base.Objects` for equality checks and hash code generation, as it is part of the standard library.
3. Replace the `try-catch` blocks in `structuralValue` and `getEncodedElementByteSize` with a more specific exception handling approach to avoid catching generic `Exception`.
4. Use `java.util.Collections.singletonList` directly in the constructor of `NonDeterministicException` instead of creating a separate constructor that takes a single reason.
5. Consider making the `Coder` class final if it is not intended to be subclassed, to prevent unintended inheritance.
6. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation from the `Context` class if it is still being used, or provide a clear alternative if it is intended to be phased out.
7. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to public methods and classes to improve code documentation and clarity for future maintainers.
