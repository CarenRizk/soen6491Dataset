1. Consider making the `transform` field final to indicate that it should not be reassigned after construction.
2. Add a null check for the `transform` parameter in the constructor to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
3. Consider adding JavaDoc comments for the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity.
4. Remove the unused `getOverriddenTransform` method if it is not utilized elsewhere in the codebase.
5. Consider using a more descriptive name for the constructor parameter `runner` if it is intended to be used in the future or remove it if it is unnecessary.
6. If the `expand` method is intended to perform more operations in the future, consider adding a comment indicating that it is currently a placeholder.
7. Consider using an interface for the `transform` field if multiple implementations are expected in the future, enhancing flexibility.
