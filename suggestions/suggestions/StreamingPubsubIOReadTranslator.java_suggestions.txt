1. Extract the argument check into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Use a constant for the error message in the `checkArgument` method to avoid hardcoding the string.
3. Consider renaming `stepContext` to `translationContext` for clarity, as it represents the context of the translation process.
4. Add comments to explain the purpose of the `translate` method and its parameters for better documentation.
5. Validate the `transform` parameter for null before using it to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
6. Consider using a logger to log the translation process for better traceability and debugging.
7. Group related method calls (like `translateOverriddenPubsubSourceStep` and `addOutput`) together to enhance code organization.
