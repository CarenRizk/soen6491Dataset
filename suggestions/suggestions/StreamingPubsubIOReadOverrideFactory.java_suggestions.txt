1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity for future developers.
2. Use more descriptive variable names in the `mapOutputs` method to enhance readability, such as renaming `outputs` to `outputCollections`.
3. Remove unnecessary imports if they are not used in the code, to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Consider implementing error handling or logging within the methods to manage potential issues during execution.
5. If applicable, consider using generics more effectively to avoid unchecked casts or warnings.
6. Review the use of `PTransformReplacement.of` to ensure that it is the most appropriate method for the intended transformation logic.
