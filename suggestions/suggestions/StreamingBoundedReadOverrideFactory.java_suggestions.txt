1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and provide context for future developers.
2. Use a more descriptive type parameter name instead of 'T' to enhance code readability, such as 'ElementType'.
3. Check if the class can implement any interfaces or extend any classes that could provide additional functionality or clarity.
4. Consider adding validation for the input parameters in the methods to ensure that they meet expected conditions before processing.
5. If applicable, consider using generics more effectively in the method signatures to enhance type safety and clarity.
6. Review the import statements to remove any unused imports, which can help clean up the code.
7. Consider adding logging statements to track the execution flow and help with debugging if necessary.
