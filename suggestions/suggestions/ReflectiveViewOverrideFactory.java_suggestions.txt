1. Consider using a more descriptive name for the variable `tracking` to improve code readability, such as `isTrackingTransform`.
2. Extract the logic inside the `visitPrimitiveTransform` method into a separate private method to reduce complexity and improve readability.
3. Use `Optional` instead of `AtomicReference` for `viewTransformRef` to simplify the logic of checking for the presence of a value.
4. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to provide better documentation and understanding of their purpose and usage.
5. Replace the `checkState` calls with more descriptive error messages that provide context about the state being checked.
6. Consider using a lambda expression instead of an anonymous inner class for the `PipelineVisitor.Defaults` to reduce boilerplate code.
7. Validate the input parameters in the constructor of `ReflectiveViewOverrideFactory` to ensure they are not null, which would prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions` later in the code.
