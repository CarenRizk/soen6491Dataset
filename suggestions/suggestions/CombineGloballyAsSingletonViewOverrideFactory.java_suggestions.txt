1. Use generics in the class declaration to avoid unchecked type casting: `CombineGloballyAsSingletonViewOverrideFactory<InputT, ViewT>` should specify the types in the `Combine.GloballyAsSingletonView` and `CombineFn` casts.
2. Replace the raw type `Class` with `Class<? extends BatchViewOverrides.BatchViewAsSingleton>` in the constructor to ensure type safety.
3. Consider extracting the logic for creating the `BatchViewOverrides.BatchViewAsSingleton` instance into a separate private method to improve readability.
4. Use `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation where necessary to indicate that unchecked casts are intentional and to suppress compiler warnings.
5. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose.
