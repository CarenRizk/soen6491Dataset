1. Consider making the constructor public or protected if this class is intended to be used outside its package.
2. Use `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` on the cast to avoid potential warnings and clarify that the developer is aware of the unchecked cast.
3. Extract the logic for creating the replacement transform into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Add JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to provide better documentation for future developers.
5. Validate the input parameters in the constructor to ensure that `replacement` and `runner` are not null, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are.
6. Consider using generics more effectively by defining a bounded type for `TransformT` to ensure it extends `PTransform`.
7. Rename the variable `rep` to something more descriptive, such as `replacementTransform`, to improve code clarity.
