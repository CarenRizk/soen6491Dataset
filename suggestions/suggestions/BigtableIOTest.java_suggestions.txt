1. Remove unused imports to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Consolidate similar validation tests for read and write operations into parameterized tests to reduce code duplication.
3. Extract common logic in tests that create `BigtableIO.Read` and `BigtableIO.Write` instances into helper methods to reduce redundancy.
4. Use constants for repeated string literals (e.g., table names, project IDs) to avoid hardcoding and improve maintainability.
5. Consider using a single `FakeBigtableService` instance instead of creating multiple instances in different tests to reduce setup complexity.
6. Refactor the `setupAndSplitBigtableSource` method to accept parameters for `bytesPerRow` and `numSamples` to make it more flexible and reusable.
7. Replace the manual creation of `ByteKey` objects in tests with a helper method to improve readability and reduce boilerplate code.
8. Use `assertThrows` instead of `thrown.expect` for exception assertions to modernize the test syntax and improve readability.
9. Group related tests together to improve the organization of the test class.
10. Consider using a mocking framework for `FakeBigtableService` to simplify the setup and improve test isolation.
