1. Consider adding Javadoc comments for the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity for future developers.
2. The constructor could benefit from parameter validation (e.g., checking if `original` or `outputCoder` is null) to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
3. The `expand` method currently does not utilize the `original` field. Consider integrating the `original` Combine operation into the `expand` method to perform the intended transformation.
4. The `expand` method could be made more descriptive by renaming the parameter `input` to something more specific, like `inputCollection`, to clarify its purpose.
5. Consider making the class `CombineGroupedValues` final if it is not intended to be subclassed, to improve performance and maintainability.
6. The `outputCoder` could be made final to indicate that it should not be changed after initialization, enhancing code safety.
7. Consider implementing `equals` and `hashCode` methods if instances of this class will be compared or used in collections that rely on these methods.
