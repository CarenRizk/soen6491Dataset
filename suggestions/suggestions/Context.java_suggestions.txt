1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still actively used and maintained, or provide a clear alternative if it is intended to be deprecated.
2. Consider adding documentation to the interface to clarify its purpose and usage, especially since it is marked as deprecated.
3. If there are no methods defined in the interface, consider whether it is necessary to have an empty interface or if it can be removed entirely.
4. Evaluate the need for the `Context` interface to extend `Environment`; if there are no additional methods or properties, consider whether this inheritance is necessary.
5. If the `Context` interface is intended for client use, consider providing a clear migration path or alternative for clients to follow if it is deprecated.
