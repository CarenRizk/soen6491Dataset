1. Extract the logic for handling bounded and unbounded PCollections into a separate private method to reduce duplication in the `expand` method of `ErrorSinkTransform`.
2. Use constants for the window duration and the combine transform names to avoid magic values and improve readability.
3. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the classes and methods to improve code documentation and clarity on their purpose.
4. Use a more descriptive type for the `BadRecord` class if it is not clear what it represents, or provide a brief comment explaining its purpose.
5. Ensure that the `BadRecord` class is properly defined and imported if it is not included in the provided code snippet.
