1. Consolidate the `verifyTrace`, `verifyDebug`, `verifyInfo`, `verifyWarn`, and `verifyError` methods into a single method that takes a `Level` parameter to reduce code duplication.
2. Consolidate the `verifyTrace`, `verifyDebug`, `verifyInfo`, `verifyWarn`, and `verifyError` methods that accept a `Throwable` parameter into a single method that takes a `Level` and `Throwable` parameter to reduce code duplication.
3. Consider using a single `matcher` method that accepts a `Level`, `substring`, and `Throwable` to reduce the number of overloaded `matcher` methods.
4. Replace the `String.format` calls in the `describeTo` methods of the matchers with a more efficient string concatenation or a `StringBuilder` to improve performance.
5. Move the `LOG_FORMATTER` initialization to a static block to clarify its purpose and ensure it is only initialized once.
6. Consider making the `logSaver` field final to indicate that it should not be reassigned after construction.
7. Consider making the `previousLevel` field final to indicate that it should not be reassigned after construction.
8. Add Javadoc comments to public methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose and usage.
9. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `getLogs` method in `LogSaver` to better convey its purpose, such as `retrieveLogs`.
10. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `reset` method in `LogSaver` to better convey its purpose, such as `clearLogs`.
