1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to explain their purpose and usage.
2. Remove the empty implementation of the `refresh` method if it is not needed, or provide a meaningful implementation if applicable.
3. Instead of returning `Collections.emptyMap()` in both `getRequestMetadata` methods, consider creating a private static final empty map to avoid creating a new instance each time the method is called.
4. Evaluate whether the `hasRequestMetadata` and `hasRequestMetadataOnly` methods need to be overridden if the default behavior is sufficient.
5. Consider implementing a constructor to allow for future extensibility or configuration of the `TestCredential` class if needed.
