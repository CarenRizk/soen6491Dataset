1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and relevant, or provide an alternative interface if it is no longer recommended for use.
2. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to each method to clarify their purpose and usage.
3. If applicable, consolidate the methods into a single method that returns a generic accumulator type, reducing redundancy.
4. Evaluate the need for the `String name` parameter in each method; consider using an enum or a predefined set of constants if the names are limited and known.
5. If the interface is intended for client use, ensure that it is well-documented and provide examples of how to implement it.
6. Consider adding default methods to provide common functionality or utility methods that could be useful for implementations.
