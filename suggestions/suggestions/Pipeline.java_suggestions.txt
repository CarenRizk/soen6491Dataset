1. Remove unused imports to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Consider using `List.of()` instead of `new ArrayList<>()` for immutable lists where applicable.
3. Replace `new HashSet<>()` with `Set.of()` for immutable sets where applicable.
4. Use `Collections.emptyList()` or `Collections.emptySet()` instead of creating new empty collections.
5. Consolidate the `applyTransform` methods into a single method that accepts an optional name parameter.
6. Extract the logic in `uniquifyInternal` into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Consider using a `Map` instead of a `Multimap` for `instancePerName` if only one transform per name is expected.
8. Use `Optional` for nullable fields like `coderRegistry` and `schemaRegistry` to avoid null checks.
9. Replace the `for` loop in `validateErrorHandlers` with a stream operation for better readability.
10. Consider using a logging framework that supports structured logging instead of string concatenation for log messages.
