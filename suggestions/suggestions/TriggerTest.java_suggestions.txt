1. Extract the common logic in the `Trigger1` and `Trigger2` classes into a base class or interface to reduce code duplication, as both classes have identical method implementations.
2. Replace the `null` values passed to the constructors of `Trigger1` and `Trigger2` with `Collections.emptyList()` to avoid potential `NullPointerException` and improve code clarity.
3. Consider using `assertThat` with matchers from a library like Hamcrest for more readable assertions instead of using `assertTrue` and `assertFalse`.
4. Use parameterized tests for the `testIsCompatible` method to reduce redundancy and improve readability by testing multiple cases in a single test method.
5. Remove the `throws Exception` declaration from the test methods since they do not throw any checked exceptions, which can simplify the method signatures.
