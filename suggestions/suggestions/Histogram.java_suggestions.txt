1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and not intended for removal.
2. Consider providing a default implementation for the `add` methods to reduce boilerplate in implementing classes.
3. Add JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods to clarify their purpose and usage.
4. If applicable, consider merging the `add` methods into a single method that accepts a variable number of arguments to simplify the interface.
5. Evaluate the necessity of the `Histogram` interface if it only extends `Accumulator` without adding additional functionality; consider removing it if it does not provide value.
