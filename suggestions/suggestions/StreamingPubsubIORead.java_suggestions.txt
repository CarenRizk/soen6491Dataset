1. Consider extracting the logic for creating the coder into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Use a more descriptive variable name for the `coder` variable to clarify its purpose, such as `pubsubCoder`.
3. If `transform.getNeedsMessageId()` is called multiple times in the future, consider caching its result in a boolean variable to avoid repeated method calls.
4. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to provide better documentation for future developers.
5. If applicable, consider making the `transform` field final to indicate that it should not be reassigned after construction.
6. Consider using an enum or a factory method for creating the coder instead of using a conditional statement to improve extensibility if more coders are added in the future.
