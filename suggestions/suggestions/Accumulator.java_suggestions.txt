1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still being used or if there are no plans to remove it in the near future.
2. Consider adding documentation to the interface to clarify its purpose and usage, especially since it is marked as internal.
3. If there are no implementing classes or if the interface is not being used, consider removing the interface entirely to reduce code clutter.
4. If the interface is intended for future use, consider adding a comment indicating the planned future functionality or usage to provide context for future developers.
