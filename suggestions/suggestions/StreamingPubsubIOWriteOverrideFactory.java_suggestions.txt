1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity for future developers.
2. Use `Collections.singletonMap` in the `mapOutputs` method instead of `Collections.emptyMap` if the method is expected to return a non-empty map in the future, to avoid unnecessary object creation.
3. If the `runner` field is not modified after construction, consider marking it as `final` to indicate that it is immutable.
4. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `transform` parameter in the `getReplacementTransform` method to improve readability.
5. If applicable, consider implementing `equals` and `hashCode` methods for the class to ensure proper behavior in collections and comparisons.
