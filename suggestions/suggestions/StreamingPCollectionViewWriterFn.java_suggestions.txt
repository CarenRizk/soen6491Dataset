1. Remove the unused import statements for `PCollection` and `DoFn.ProcessElement` as they are not utilized in the code.
2. Consider making the `view` and `dataCoder` fields final to ensure they are immutable after construction.
3. Change the visibility of the constructor to private if it is only intended to be used within the class, which is already the case, but could be explicitly noted.
4. Add Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose.
5. Consider implementing the `Serializable` interface if instances of this class are intended to be serialized, especially since it is used in a distributed processing framework.
6. Remove the `@ProcessElement` annotation from the `processElement` method if it is not intended to be executed, as it may create confusion about the class's intended use.
