1. Remove unused imports to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Replace `new StringBuilder().append(...)` with `String.format(...)` or string concatenation for better readability.
3. Consider using constants for repeated strings like "projects/my-project/topics/" to avoid duplication and potential errors.
4. Extract the logic for creating `IncomingMessage` objects into a separate method to reduce code duplication in the `setupTestClient` method.
5. Use `List.of(...)` instead of `ImmutableList.of(...)` for immutable lists where applicable to simplify the code.
6. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `GenericClass` to better convey its purpose.
7. Use `Optional` for nullable fields in `GenericClass` to improve null safety.
8. Replace `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` with a dedicated method to generate unique IDs to improve readability and maintainability.
9. Consolidate the repeated logic for validating topics into a single helper method to reduce redundancy.
10. Use `assertThat` consistently instead of mixing it with `assertEquals` for better readability and consistency in assertions.
