1. Extract the logic for adding inputs to `stepContext` into a separate private method to reduce duplication and improve readability.
2. Use a guard clause for the null check on `overriddenTransform.getTopicProvider()` to reduce nesting and improve clarity.
3. Consider using a switch statement or a map for handling the different properties being added to `stepContext` based on the attributes of `overriddenTransform` to streamline the code.
4. Create a helper method to handle the serialization of `IdentityMessageFn` to avoid repeating the serialization logic.
5. Consider using constants for the property names instead of directly using `PropertyNames` to improve maintainability and reduce potential errors from typos.
6. Add comments to clarify the purpose of each section of the code, especially where the logic may not be immediately clear to future readers.
