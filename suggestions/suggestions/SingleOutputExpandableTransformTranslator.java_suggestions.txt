1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and method to describe their purpose and usage.
2. Use a more specific type for the output variable instead of using a wildcard (`PCollection<?>`), if the type can be determined.
3. Extract the string "ExternalTransform" into a constant to avoid magic strings and improve maintainability.
4. Consider adding error handling or logging in case the context does not contain the expected output for the transform.
5. If applicable, check if the `addOutput` method can be chained to reduce the number of lines in the `translate` method.
