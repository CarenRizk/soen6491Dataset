1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and not intended for removal.
2. Consider merging the two `increment` methods into a single method that accepts an optional parameter, reducing method overload.
3. If the `Accumulator` interface has common functionality, ensure that it is well-documented to clarify its purpose and usage.
4. Add JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods to provide clear documentation for future developers.
5. If the `Counter` interface is not intended to be implemented directly, consider making it a marker interface or using a more specific design pattern.
