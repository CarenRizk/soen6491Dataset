1. Remove unused imports to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Replace anonymous inner classes for `SimpleFunction` with lambda expressions where possible to simplify the code.
3. Consolidate the `getPipeline` methods into a single method that accepts an optional parameter for `blockOnRun` to reduce redundancy.
4. Extract repeated code for creating `PCollection<byte[]>` with `MapElements` into a separate method to avoid duplication.
5. Use `Optional.ofNullable` instead of `Optional` for handling potential null values in `StaticQueue` to improve clarity.
6. Consider using a `List` instead of an `ArrayBlockingQueue` in `StaticQueue` if the size is not a concern, to simplify the implementation.
7. Move the `TEARDOWN_CALL` variable to a more appropriate scope or encapsulate it within a class to avoid potential issues with shared state.
8. Use `assertThrows` instead of `thrown.expect` for exception assertions to modernize the test code.
9. Group related test methods together to improve organization and readability.
10. Add comments to complex sections of the code to enhance understanding for future maintainers.
