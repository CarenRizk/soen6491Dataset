1. Extract the logic for creating the `PCollection<ValueWithRecordId<T>>` in the `ReadWithIds` class into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Consider using a constant for the "StripIds" string in the `expand` method to avoid magic strings and improve maintainability.
3. Move the `validate()` call to a separate method to improve the readability of the `expand` method.
4. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the `StreamingUnboundedRead` and `ReadWithIds` classes to explain their purpose and usage.
5. Use a more descriptive name for the `Deduplicate` class if it is not clear from the context what it does.
6. Consider handling the case where `source` is null in the constructor of `StreamingUnboundedRead` to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions.
7. Remove the static block for `DataflowPipelineTranslator.registerTransformTranslator` if it is not necessary or if it can be moved to a more appropriate location in the codebase.
