1. Remove the unused import statements to clean up the code, such as `import java.util.Iterator;` and `import org.apache.beam.sdk.coders.CustomCoder;` if they are not used in the code.
2. Consider using `List.of()` instead of `Lists.newArrayList()` for creating immutable lists when appropriate, such as in `Collections.emptyList()`.
3. Replace `Lists.newArrayListWithCapacity(bufferSize)` with `new ArrayList<>(bufferSize)` for better readability.
4. In the `collapseIfNeeded` method, consider using a `List<QuantileBuffer<T>>` instead of `Lists.newArrayList()` to create a new list.
5. In the `QuantileStateCoder` class, consider using `try-with-resources` for `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream` to ensure proper resource management.
6. In the `QuantileStateCoder` class, consider extracting the encoding and decoding logic for `QuantileBuffer` into separate methods to reduce code duplication.
7. Consider adding validation for the parameters in the `QuantileState` constructor to ensure they are within expected ranges.
8. In the `QuantileState` class, consider using `Optional<T>` for `min` and `max` instead of nullable types to improve null safety.
9. In the `QuantileState` class, consider using a `Set` instead of a `List` for `unbufferedElements` if uniqueness is required.
10. In the `QuantileStateCoder` class, consider using `List<T>` directly in the constructor instead of creating a new list in `decodeBuffer` to avoid unnecessary object creation.
