1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose and usage.
2. Use a more descriptive type parameter name instead of "T" to enhance readability, such as "ElementType" or "OutputType".
3. Check if the class could implement any interfaces or extend any classes that would provide additional functionality or clarity.
4. Evaluate whether the class could benefit from additional validation or error handling in the `getReplacementTransform` method.
5. Consider using a more specific type for the `outputs` parameter in the `mapOutputs` method if applicable, to improve type safety and clarity.
6. If the class is intended to be used in a multi-threaded context, consider adding synchronization mechanisms or making it thread-safe.
7. Review the imports and remove any unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
