1. Consider adding Javadoc comments for the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity on usage.
2. The constructor could validate the parameters to ensure that `original` and `outputCoder` are not null, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are.
3. The `expand` method currently does not utilize the `original` field. Consider integrating the `original` Combine operation into the `expand` method to perform the actual combining logic.
4. The `expand` method could be made more descriptive by renaming the parameter `input` to something more specific, such as `inputCollection`, to clarify its purpose.
5. Consider making the class `CombineGroupedValues` final if it is not intended to be subclassed, to prevent inheritance and improve performance.
6. The `outputCoder` could be made final to indicate that it should not change after construction, improving immutability.
7. Consider implementing the `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the class, which can be useful for debugging.
8. If applicable, consider adding unit tests for the class to ensure its functionality is verified and to facilitate future changes.
