1. Consider making the `transform` field final to ensure it is immutable after construction.
2. Add validation in the constructor to check if the `transform` parameter is null, throwing an IllegalArgumentException if it is.
3. Change the visibility of the `getOverriddenTransform` method to public if it is intended to be accessed outside the class.
4. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity.
5. Remove the static block for registration if it can be done in a more centralized location or if it is not necessary for the class to handle its own registration.
6. Consider using a constructor with parameters for `DataflowRunner` if it is not used in the class, or remove it if it is unnecessary.
