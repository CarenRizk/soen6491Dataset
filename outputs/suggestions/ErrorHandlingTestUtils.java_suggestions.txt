1. Extract the logic for handling bounded and unbounded inputs in the `ErrorSinkTransform` class into a separate private method to improve readability and reduce duplication.
2. Use constants for the transform names ("Combine", "Window") to avoid hardcoding strings and improve maintainability.
3. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the classes and methods to provide better documentation and context for future developers.
4. Remove unnecessary annotations (`@UnknownKeyFor`, `@NonNull`, `@Initialized`) in the `expand` method of `ErrorSinkTransform` if they do not serve a specific purpose, as they can clutter the code.
5. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `BadRecord` class if it is not clear what it represents, to enhance code clarity.
