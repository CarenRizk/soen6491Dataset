1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and has not been replaced, or provide a clear alternative if it is deprecated.
2. Consider removing the `Context` interface if it is not being used anywhere in the codebase, as it may add unnecessary complexity.
3. If the `Context` interface is intended to be used, ensure that it has meaningful methods defined, as an empty interface may not provide value.
4. Review the `Environment` interface to ensure that it is still relevant and necessary for the `Context` interface to extend; consider simplifying the hierarchy if possible.
