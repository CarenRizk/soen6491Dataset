1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose and usage.
2. Check if the generic type parameter `T` can be constrained further to improve type safety and clarity.
3. Evaluate if the `mapOutputs` method could benefit from additional validation or error handling for the input parameters.
4. Consider using more descriptive variable names in the `mapOutputs` method to enhance readability.
5. Review the import statements to remove any unused imports, if applicable.
