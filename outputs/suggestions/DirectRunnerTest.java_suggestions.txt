1. Remove the unused import statements to improve code clarity and reduce clutter.
2. Replace the anonymous inner classes used in `MapElements.via` with lambda expressions where possible to simplify the code.
3. Consider extracting the `SerializableFunction<Integer, byte[]> getBytes` into a separate method or a utility class to avoid duplication and improve readability.
4. Consolidate the repeated logic in the `testMutatingOutputThenTerminateDoFnError` and `testMutatingOutputCoderDoFnError` tests into a single helper method to reduce code duplication.
5. Use `assertThrows` instead of `thrown.expect` for exception assertions in tests to modernize the testing style and improve readability.
6. Consider using `@Before` or `@BeforeEach` annotations to set up common test objects or states, such as creating a `Pipeline` instance, to reduce redundancy in test methods.
7. Remove the `@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")` annotation if it is not necessary, as it can hide potential issues in the code.
8. Consider using `CompletableFuture` instead of `Future` for better handling of asynchronous tasks in the `testNoBlockOnRunState` method.
9. Use `assertThat` consistently with matchers instead of mixing it with `assertEquals` for better readability and consistency in assertions.
10. Consider adding more descriptive comments or JavaDoc to complex methods to improve code maintainability and understanding for future developers.
