1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and not intended for removal, or provide a clear alternative if it is deprecated.
2. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods to provide clear documentation on their purpose and usage.
3. If applicable, implement default methods for the `add` methods to provide a default behavior or to reduce boilerplate in implementing classes.
4. If the `Accumulator` interface has methods that are not being utilized in this interface, consider removing the inheritance to simplify the design.
5. Evaluate whether the `long times` parameter in the second `add` method could be replaced with a more descriptive type or class to improve readability and maintainability.
