1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity for future developers.
2. Use more descriptive variable names in the `mapOutputs` method to enhance readability, such as renaming `outputs` to `outputCollections`.
3. Check if the `StreamingPubsubIORead` constructor can be simplified or if any parameters can be made optional to reduce complexity.
4. If applicable, consider implementing interfaces for better abstraction and to facilitate testing.
5. Review the exception handling strategy in the class to ensure that potential errors are managed appropriately.
6. Evaluate the use of generics in the class to ensure type safety and reduce the risk of runtime errors.
7. Consider breaking down the `getReplacementTransform` method into smaller methods if it grows in complexity in the future.
