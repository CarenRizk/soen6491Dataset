1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarity for future developers.
2. Use `Collections.singletonMap` in the `mapOutputs` method instead of `Collections.emptyMap` if there is a possibility of returning a single output in the future, to enhance flexibility.
3. Validate the input parameters in the constructor and methods to ensure they are not null, which can help prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
4. Consider using `@NonNull` or similar annotations for method parameters and return types to improve code readability and enforce null safety.
5. If applicable, implement logging within the methods to track the flow of execution and any potential issues during runtime.
6. Consider extracting the creation of the `StreamingPubsubIOWrite` instance into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability of the `getReplacementTransform` method.
