1. Consider making the constructor public or protected if this class is intended to be used outside of its package, to improve accessibility.
2. Use `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation when casting `transform.getTransform().getClass()` to `Class<TransformT>` to avoid unchecked cast warnings.
3. Extract the logic for creating the replacement transform into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Add JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to provide better documentation and understanding of their purpose and usage.
5. Consider using `Optional<Class<TransformT>>` for the transform class parameter to handle cases where it might not be present, improving robustness.
6. Validate the input parameters in the constructor to ensure that `replacement` and `runner` are not null, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are.
7. Rename the variable `rep` to something more descriptive, such as `replacementTransform`, to enhance code clarity.
