1. Consider extracting the logic inside the for loop into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Use a more descriptive variable name than `taggedOutput` for better clarity on what the variable represents.
3. Add comments to explain the purpose of the `translate` method and the overall functionality of the class.
4. Validate that the `outputs` map is not null before iterating over it to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions.
5. Consider using a stream to process the entries in the `outputs` map for a more modern and concise approach.
6. If applicable, handle potential exceptions that may arise during the translation process to improve robustness.
