1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and has not been replaced, or provide a clear alternative if it is deprecated.
2. Consider adding documentation to the interface to explain its purpose and usage, especially since it is marked as internal.
3. If there are no methods in the interface, consider whether it is necessary to keep it as an interface or if it could be replaced with an abstract class or a marker interface.
4. Review the necessity of the `@Audience` annotation and ensure it aligns with the intended visibility and usage of the interface.
5. If the interface is intended for internal use only, consider moving it to a more appropriate package or module to reflect its usage context.
