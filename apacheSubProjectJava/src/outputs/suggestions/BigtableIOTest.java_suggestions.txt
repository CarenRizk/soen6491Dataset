1. Remove unused imports to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Consolidate repetitive code in tests that validate missing parameters by creating a helper method.
3. Replace the use of `StaticValueProvider.of(Collections.singletonList(ByteKeyRange.ALL_KEYS))` with a constant to avoid repetition.
4. Consider using a single method for creating `ByteKeyRange` instances to reduce code duplication.
5. Extract the logic for setting up `BigtableSource` into a separate method to avoid repetition in tests.
6. Use `List.of()` instead of `Collections.singletonList()` for creating immutable lists where applicable.
7. Replace the `for` loop in `setupSampleRowKeys` with a stream to enhance readability and conciseness.
8. Consider using `Optional` for methods that may return null to avoid null checks and improve code safety.
9. Use `assertThrows` instead of `thrown.expect` for exception assertions in tests to modernize the testing style.
10. Group related constants together for better organization and readability.
11. Consider using a builder pattern for constructing complex objects like `BigtableIO.Read` and `BigtableIO.Write` to improve readability.
12. Remove the `@SuppressWarnings("unused")` annotations if the methods are not used anywhere in the code.
13. Use meaningful variable names in tests to improve clarity and understanding of the test's purpose.
14. Consider using parameterized tests for similar test cases to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
15. Refactor the `FakeBigtableService` class to separate concerns and improve testability.
