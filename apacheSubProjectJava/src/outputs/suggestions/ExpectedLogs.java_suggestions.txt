1. Consolidate the `verifyTrace`, `verifyDebug`, `verifyInfo`, `verifyWarn`, and `verifyError` methods into a single method that takes a `Level` parameter to reduce code duplication.
2. Consolidate the `verifyTrace`, `verifyDebug`, `verifyInfo`, `verifyWarn`, and `verifyError` methods that accept a `Throwable` parameter into a single method that takes a `Level` and `Throwable` parameter to reduce code duplication.
3. Consider using a single `matcher` method that accepts a `Level`, `String`, and `Throwable` to reduce the number of overloaded methods and improve clarity.
4. Move the `LOG_FORMATTER` declaration closer to its usage to improve code readability.
5. Consider making `logSaver` and `previousLevel` final since they are only assigned once in the constructor.
6. Use `String.format` in a consistent manner across all methods for better readability and maintainability.
7. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to public methods to improve code documentation and understanding.
8. Remove the `@ThreadSafe` annotation from the `LogSaver` class if it is not guaranteed to be thread-safe, or ensure that the implementation is indeed thread-safe.
9. Consider renaming the `getLogs` and `reset` methods in `LogSaver` to be public if they are intended to be accessed outside the class, or keep them private if they are only for internal use.
10. Use `Collections.unmodifiableCollection(logRecords)` in the `getLogs` method to prevent external modification of the log records collection.
