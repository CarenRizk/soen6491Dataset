1. Consider making the `transform` field final to ensure it is immutable after construction.
2. Use a ternary operator directly in the `PCollection.createPrimitiveOutputInternal` method call to reduce the number of lines and improve readability.
3. Extract the logic for determining the coder into a private method to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
4. Add Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to improve documentation and understanding of the code's purpose and functionality.
5. Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `coder` to clarify its purpose, such as `pubsubCoder`.
6. If applicable, consider adding validation for the `transform` parameter in the constructor to ensure it is not null.
7. If the `getOverriddenTransform` method is not used outside of this class, consider making it private to encapsulate the implementation details.
