1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and method to explain their purpose and usage.
2. Use a more specific type for the output variable instead of using a wildcard (PCollection<?>), if possible, to improve type safety and clarity.
3. Extract the string "ExternalTransform" into a constant to avoid magic strings and improve maintainability.
4. Consider handling potential exceptions that may arise from casting or retrieving the output from the context.
5. If applicable, add validation for the transform parameter to ensure it is not null before proceeding with the translation.
