1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still in use and intended for future use, or provide a clear alternative if it is truly deprecated.
2. Consider merging the two `increment` methods into a single method that accepts an optional parameter, to reduce method overload and improve clarity.
3. Add JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods to provide clear documentation on their intended use and behavior.
4. If applicable, consider using a more descriptive name for the `Counter` interface to better convey its purpose within the context of the application.
5. Evaluate whether the `Counter` interface should extend `Accumulator`, and if so, ensure that the relationship is clearly defined and documented.
