1. Extract the logic for handling deduplication and stripping IDs into separate private methods to improve readability in the `expand` method.
2. Consider using a factory method to create the `ReadWithIds` transform to reduce duplication in the `expand` method.
3. Move the `validate` call for the source to a separate method to improve separation of concerns and enhance readability.
4. Use constants for the string "StripIds" to avoid magic strings and improve maintainability.
5. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and methods to improve documentation and clarify their purpose.
6. Implement error handling for the `validate` method to provide more informative feedback if validation fails.
7. Consider using a builder pattern for constructing `StreamingUnboundedRead` if it requires additional configuration in the future.
