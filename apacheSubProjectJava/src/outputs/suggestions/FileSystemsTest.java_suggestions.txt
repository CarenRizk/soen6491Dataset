1. Replace repeated calls to `FileSystems.getFileSystemInternal(toLocalResourceId(...).getScheme())` in `testGetLocalFileSystem` with a helper method to reduce redundancy.
2. Extract the creation of `ResourceId` lists in `testDeleteIgnoreMissingFiles`, `testCopyThrowsNoSuchFileException`, `testCopyIgnoreMissingFiles`, `testRenameThrowsNoSuchFileException`, `testCopySkipIfItExists`, and `testRenameIgnoreMissingFiles` into a separate method to avoid code duplication.
3. Consolidate the assertions in `testCopyIgnoreMissingFiles` and `testRenameIgnoreMissingFiles` regarding file existence and content into a single helper method to improve readability and reduce redundancy.
4. Use a parameterized test for `testMatchNewDirectory` to reduce boilerplate code and improve maintainability.
5. Consider using constants for the string literals used in the tests (e.g., "content1", "content3") to avoid magic strings and improve clarity.
6. Replace the `assertTrue` checks for file existence with a single method that checks multiple files to reduce redundancy.
7. Use `assertThrows` instead of `thrown.expect` for exception assertions to modernize the test style and improve readability.
8. Remove unnecessary comments like `/* isDirectory */` in method calls to improve code clarity.
9. Consider using a single method to handle the creation of files with content, as seen in `createFileWithContent`, to reduce the number of similar methods.
