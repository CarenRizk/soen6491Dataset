1. Remove deprecated methods `encode(T value, OutputStream outStream, Context context)` and `decode(InputStream inStream, Context context)` to simplify the code and reduce confusion.
2. Consider using `java.util.Objects` instead of `org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v32_1_2_jre.com.google.common.base.Objects` for equality checks and hash code generation, as it is part of the standard library.
3. Replace `ByteArrayOutputStream` with a more efficient alternative if applicable, or ensure that it is the best choice for the use case.
4. Extract the error message construction in `structuralValue` and `getEncodedElementByteSize` into a separate method to reduce code duplication and improve readability.
5. Consider making the `Context` class a static nested class if it is only used within the `Coder` class, to encapsulate its usage.
6. Use `List.of()` instead of `Collections.singletonList()` for creating single-element lists in `NonDeterministicException` constructors for better readability and performance.
7. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to public methods and classes to improve code documentation and understanding.
8. Review the `isRegisterByteSizeObserverCheap` method to determine if it should be abstract or if a default implementation should be provided, to enforce consistency across subclasses.
9. Ensure that the `Coder` class is thread-safe if it is intended to be used in a concurrent environment, as it currently does not provide any synchronization mechanisms.
