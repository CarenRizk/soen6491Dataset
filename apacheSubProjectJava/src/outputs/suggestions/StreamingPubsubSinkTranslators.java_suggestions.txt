1. Extract the logic for adding inputs to `stepContext` into a separate private method to improve readability and reduce complexity in the `translate` method.
2. Create a helper method to handle the logic of adding the topic input based on whether the `topicProvider` is accessible or not, to avoid code duplication.
3. Consider using a builder pattern for constructing the `stepContext` inputs, which can make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
4. Introduce constants for the property names used in `stepContext.addInput` calls to avoid potential typos and improve maintainability.
5. Validate the `overriddenTransform` object for null values at the beginning of the `translate` method to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
6. Group related input additions together to improve the logical flow and readability of the code.
7. Consider logging or handling cases where `overriddenTransform.getTopicProvider()` is null to provide better debugging information.
