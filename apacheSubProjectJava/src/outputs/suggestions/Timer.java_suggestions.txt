1. Remove the deprecated annotation if the interface is no longer intended for use, or provide an alternative interface for users to migrate to.
2. Consider providing a default implementation for the `add(Duration duration)` method to reduce the need for implementing classes to define it.
3. Add JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods to clarify their purpose and usage.
4. Evaluate whether the `Timer` interface should extend `Accumulator`, and if so, ensure that the methods in `Accumulator` are relevant to `Timer`.
5. Consider using `java.time.Instant` instead of `Duration` if the intention is to work with specific points in time rather than durations.
6. If the `add(long duration, TimeUnit unit)` method is frequently used, consider adding a convenience method that accepts a `Duration` directly to improve usability.
7. Review the need for both `add(Duration duration)` and `add(long duration, TimeUnit unit)` methods to avoid redundancy and simplify the interface.
