1. Remove the unused import statements to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Consider consolidating the multiple `addNullable*Field` methods into a single method that takes a `FieldType` parameter to reduce redundancy.
3. The `setOptions` methods in the `Builder` class could be combined into a single method that accepts either an `Options` object or an `Options.Builder` to simplify the API.
4. The `collectFields` method could be made private since it is only used within the `Schema` class.
5. The `areUuidsEqual` method could be made private as it is only used within the `equals` and `typesEqual` methods.
6. The `UUID` field could be initialized directly in the constructor instead of being set to `null` and then assigned a new value later.
7. The `encodingPositions` field could be initialized as an immutable map to prevent accidental modifications after construction.
8. Consider using `Optional<UUID>` instead of `@Nullable UUID` for better null safety and clarity.
9. The `toSnakeCase` and `toCamelCase` methods have similar logic; consider extracting the common logic into a private method to reduce code duplication.
10. The `Field` class could benefit from a `withOptions` method that accepts a `List<Options>` to allow for multiple options to be added at once.
11. The `FieldType` class could have a method to check if it is a collection type instead of relying on multiple checks in the `equivalent` method.
12. The `Options` class could have a method to retrieve an option by name with a default value to simplify option retrieval.
13. The `toString` methods in various classes could be enhanced to provide more meaningful output, especially for complex objects like `FieldType` and `Options`.
14. The `FieldType` class could benefit from a factory method pattern to create instances instead of using a builder for every type.
15. The `equals` and `hashCode` methods in the `Field` and `FieldType` classes could be optimized to avoid unnecessary calls to `Objects.equals` for fields that are already known to be equal.
