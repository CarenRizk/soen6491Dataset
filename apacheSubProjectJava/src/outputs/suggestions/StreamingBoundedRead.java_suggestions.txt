1. Consider making the `source` field final to ensure it is immutable after construction.
2. Add null checks for the `transform` parameter in the constructor to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
3. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and understanding.
4. Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `input` in the `expand` method to clarify its purpose.
5. Consider extracting the `Pipeline.applyTransform` call into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Handle potential exceptions that may arise from `source.validate()` to ensure robustness.
7. Consider using a logging framework to log validation results or errors instead of relying solely on exceptions.
