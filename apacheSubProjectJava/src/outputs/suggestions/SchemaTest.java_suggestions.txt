1. Extract repeated assertions in the `testCreate` method into a helper method to reduce code duplication.
2. Combine the `testArraySchema`, `testArrayOfRowSchema`, and `testNestedArraySchema` methods into a single parameterized test method to reduce redundancy.
3. Combine the `testIterableSchema`, `testIterableOfRowSchema`, and `testNestedIterableSchema` methods into a single parameterized test method to reduce redundancy.
4. Extract the common logic in `testToSnakeCase` and `testToCamelCase` into a helper method to avoid code duplication.
5. Extract the repeated schema creation logic in `testSorted` and `testNestedSorted` into a helper method to reduce redundancy.
6. Create a helper method for the assertions in `testEquivalent` to avoid code duplication when asserting equivalence of schemas.
7. Consolidate the assertions in `testPrimitiveNotEquivalent` into a loop or a helper method to reduce redundancy.
8. Extract the repeated schema creation logic in `testFieldsWithDifferentMetadataAreEquivalent` into a helper method to reduce redundancy.
9. Combine the `testArrayNotEquivalent`, `testNestedArraysNotEquivalent`, and `testMapNotEquivalent` methods into a single parameterized test method to reduce redundancy.
10. Extract the repeated assertions in `testLogicalType` into a helper method to reduce code duplication.
