1. Remove the unused import statements for `org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.BoundedWindow` and `org.apache.beam.sdk.values.PCollection` as they are not used in the code.
2. Consider making the `view` and `dataCoder` fields final to ensure they are immutable after construction.
3. Change the visibility of the constructor to private if it is only intended to be accessed via the static `create` method, which is already the case.
4. Add Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose.
5. Consider using a more specific type for `PCollectionView<?>` instead of the wildcard if possible, to enhance type safety.
6. The `processElement` method could be improved by providing a more informative message in the `UnsupportedOperationException`, possibly including the class name and the intended usage.
