1. Extract common functionality from Trigger1 and Trigger2 into a base class or interface to reduce code duplication, as both classes have identical implementations for the methods.
2. Replace the use of `null` for subTriggers in Trigger1 and Trigger2 with an empty list to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions and improve code safety.
3. Consider using parameterized tests for the test cases in testIsCompatible to reduce redundancy and improve readability.
4. Use constants for the expected string values in testTriggerToString to avoid hardcoding strings multiple times.
5. Add meaningful comments or JavaDoc to explain the purpose of the Trigger1 and Trigger2 classes, as well as the test methods, to improve code maintainability.
