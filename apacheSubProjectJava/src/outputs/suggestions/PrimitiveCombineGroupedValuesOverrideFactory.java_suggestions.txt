1. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation and clarify their purpose and usage.
2. Use more descriptive variable names in the `getReplacementTransform` method to enhance readability, such as renaming `transform` to `appliedTransform`.
3. Extract the creation of the `CombineGroupedValues` instance into a separate private method to reduce complexity in the `getReplacementTransform` method.
4. Consider adding input validation in the `getReplacementTransform` method to handle potential null values for `transform` or its outputs.
5. Use constants for repeated strings or values if applicable, to avoid magic values and improve maintainability.
6. Ensure consistent formatting and indentation throughout the code for better readability.
