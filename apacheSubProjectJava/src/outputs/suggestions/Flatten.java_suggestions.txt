1. In the `PCollections` class, extract the logic for checking window function compatibility and trigger compatibility into separate private methods to improve readability and reduce code duplication.

2. In the `PCollections` class, consider using a `Stream` to iterate over `inputs.getAll()` instead of a for-loop to make the code more concise and expressive.

3. In the `PCollections` class, initialize `windowingStrategy` and `isBounded` in a single line when `inputs.getAll()` is empty to reduce the number of lines in the `if` statement.

4. In the `Iterables` class, extract the logic for checking the input coder type into a private method to improve readability.

5. In the `Iterables` class, consider using a lambda expression instead of an anonymous inner class for the `SimpleFunction` to make the code more concise.

6. In the `expand` method of the `Iterables` class, handle the case where `in.getCoder()` might return `null` to avoid potential `NullPointerException`.

7. In the `expand` method of the `PCollections` class, consider logging the incompatible window functions and triggers instead of throwing an exception directly, which could help in debugging.

8. In both `PCollections` and `Iterables` classes, add JavaDoc comments to the classes and methods to provide better documentation for future developers.
