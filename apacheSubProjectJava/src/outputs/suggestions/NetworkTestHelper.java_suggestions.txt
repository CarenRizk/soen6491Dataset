1. Remove the `synchronized` keyword from the `getAvailableLocalPort` method, as it is not necessary for this method's functionality and could lead to performance issues in a multi-threaded environment.
2. Consider adding a comment to explain the purpose of the method and how it works, to improve code readability and maintainability.
3. Handle the potential `IOException` more gracefully, possibly by logging the error or providing a fallback mechanism instead of allowing it to propagate unchecked.
4. Consider using a more descriptive exception type or custom exception if the method fails, to provide more context about the failure.
5. If this method is intended to be used in a multi-threaded context, consider implementing a more robust mechanism for port availability checking rather than relying solely on `ServerSocket`.
