1. Remove the `@Deprecated` annotation if the interface is still intended for use, or provide an alternative interface if it is truly deprecated.
2. Consider adding JavaDoc comments to each method to clarify their purpose and usage.
3. If the methods are not intended to be overridden, consider marking them as `default` to provide default implementations.
4. If the interface is part of a larger framework, consider organizing related interfaces into a package or module for better structure.
5. Evaluate the need for the `String name` parameter in each method; if there's a common pattern or set of names, consider using an enum or a constants class to avoid potential errors with string literals.
