1. Consolidate the repeated logic in the `asPath`, `asV1Beta1Path`, and `asV1Beta2Path` methods in both `PubsubSubscription` and `PubsubTopic` classes into a single method that handles the path generation based on the type.
2. Extract the common validation logic in `validateProjectName` and `validatePubsubName` into a utility class to reduce duplication.
3. Consider using a single regex pattern for validating both subscription and topic paths to avoid redundancy in `fromPath` methods.
4. Replace the multiple `if` statements in `validatePubsubName` with a single method that checks all conditions and throws an exception if any are violated.
5. Use a common method to handle the logging of deprecated methods to avoid code duplication in `PubsubSubscription` and `PubsubTopic`.
6. Refactor the `expandReadContinued` method to separate concerns by extracting the logic for handling bad records into a separate method.
7. Consider using a builder pattern for the `OutgoingData` class to improve readability and maintainability.
8. Replace the `if` checks for `null` with `Optional` to improve code clarity in methods like `expand`.
9. Use constants for the error messages in `IllegalArgumentException` to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.
10. Simplify the `processElement` method in `PubsubBoundedWriter` by extracting the logic for handling the message size and publishing into separate methods.
