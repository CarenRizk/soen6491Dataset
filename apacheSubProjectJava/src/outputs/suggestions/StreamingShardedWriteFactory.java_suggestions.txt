1. Extract the logic for determining `numShards` into a separate private method to improve readability and reduce complexity in the `getReplacementTransform` method.
2. Replace the `RuntimeException` in the catch block with a more specific exception type or a custom exception to provide better context for the error.
3. Consider using `Optional` for handling the case where `options` might not be of type `DataflowPipelineWorkerPoolOptions` to avoid potential `ClassCastException`.
4. Use constants or configuration for the multiplier (currently `2`) when calculating `numShards` to improve maintainability and clarity.
5. Add logging in the catch block to capture the exception details before throwing the `RuntimeException` for better debugging.
6. Consider validating the `options` object in the constructor to ensure it is not null and is of the expected type, throwing an appropriate exception if it is invalid.
7. Group related import statements together to improve code organization and readability.
