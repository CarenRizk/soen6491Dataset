1. Consider adding Javadoc comments to the class and its methods to explain their purpose and usage.
2. Remove the redundant `getRequestMetadata()` method that does not take a URI, as it simply returns an empty map and could be consolidated with the other method.
3. Implement the `refresh()` method to provide a meaningful operation or throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it is not intended to be used.
4. Consider using `Collections.emptyMap()` in a static context to avoid creating a new instance each time the method is called.
5. Evaluate whether the `hasRequestMetadata()` and `hasRequestMetadataOnly()` methods need to be overridden if they are not providing additional functionality beyond the default implementation.
