1. Replace the `switch` statement in the `writeToFile` method with a `Map<Compression, Function<OutputStream, OutputStream>>` to eliminate the need for multiple case statements and improve readability.
2. Extract the logic for creating a `ZipOutputStream` into a separate method to reduce complexity in the `writeToFile` method.
3. Use `try-with-resources` in the `createZipFile` method to ensure that the `ZipOutputStream` and `PrintStream` are closed properly, avoiding potential resource leaks.
4. Combine the two `getTextSource` methods into a single method with an optional parameter for `skipHeaderLines`, using method overloading to handle the default case.
5. Replace the `for` loop in `makeLines` with `IntStream.range(0, n).mapToObj(i -> "word" + i).collect(Collectors.toList())` for a more concise and functional approach.
6. Use `List.of()` instead of `Arrays.asList()` for immutable lists where applicable, such as in the `EMPTY` and `TINY` constants.
7. Consider using a `StringBuilder` in the `writeToStreamAndClose` method instead of `PrintStream` for writing lines to the output stream to avoid unnecessary object creation.
8. Refactor the `assertReadingCompressedFileMatchesExpected` method to reduce duplication by creating a helper method for the repeated `PAssert.that` calls.
9. Move the `assertReaderInitialState` and `assertReaderStateAfterAdvance` methods to a utility class if they are used in multiple test classes to promote code reuse.
10. Replace the `assertEquals` calls with `assertThat` and matchers from Hamcrest for better readability and consistency in assertions.
