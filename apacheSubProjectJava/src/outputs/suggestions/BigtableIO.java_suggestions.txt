1. Remove unused imports to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
2. Consolidate similar methods that accept both `ValueProvider` and direct types (e.g., `withProjectId`, `withInstanceId`, etc.) into a single method that accepts a `ValueProvider` and a direct type, reducing redundancy.
3. Consider using `Optional` for nullable return types instead of `@Nullable` annotations to improve clarity and safety.
4. Replace `checkArgument` with `checkNotNull` where applicable to simplify null checks.
5. Extract repeated logic for validating configurations into a separate private method to reduce code duplication.
6. Use a consistent logging strategy, ensuring that all log messages follow a similar format and include relevant context.
7. Consider using a builder pattern for `BigtableSource` to simplify the construction of objects with many parameters.
8. Review the use of `@VisibleForTesting` annotations to ensure they are applied only where necessary and to improve encapsulation.
9. Refactor the `validateTableExists` method to handle exceptions more gracefully and provide clearer error messages.
10. Consider using a more structured approach for handling configuration validation, possibly using a configuration class or builder to encapsulate related settings.
