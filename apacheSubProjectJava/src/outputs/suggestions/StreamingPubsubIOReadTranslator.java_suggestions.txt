1. Extract the argument check into a separate private method to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Use a constant for the error message in the `checkArgument` call to avoid duplication and enhance clarity.
3. Consider renaming `stepContext` to `translationContext` for better clarity on its purpose.
4. Add comments to explain the purpose of each step in the `translate` method for better understanding.
5. Validate the `transform` parameter for null before using it to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
