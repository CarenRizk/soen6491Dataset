1. Consider extracting the logic for creating the `ExecutorService` into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Move the initialization of `MAPPER` to a static block or a dedicated method to enhance clarity and separation of concerns.
3. Replace the repeated calls to `PTransformOverride.of()` with a helper method that takes parameters to reduce redundancy in the `sideInputUsingTransformOverrides` and `groupByKeyOverrides` methods.
4. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `enabledEnforcements` variable to clarify its purpose.
5. Refactor the `defaultModelEnforcements` method to separate the logic for building the `ImmutableMap` and the logic for adding enforcements, improving readability.
6. Extract the logic for handling exceptions in the `run` method into a separate method to reduce complexity and improve clarity.
7. Consider using a constant for the thread name format in the `ExecutorService` creation to avoid magic strings.
8. Use a more descriptive name for the `graphVisitor` variable to clarify its role in the `run` method.
9. Consider using a `try-with-resources` statement for the `ExecutorService` to ensure proper resource management and avoid potential memory leaks.
10. Add comments to complex sections of the code to improve understanding for future maintainers.
